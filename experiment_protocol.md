# Acid Marble Experiment Protocol

## Objective
Observe the chemical reaction of acids on marble (CaCO₃) and the effect on plant leaves.

## Materials
- 3 clear cups
- Small pieces of marble
- 10 ml water, vinegar, hydrochloric acid (HCl)
- Fresh plant leaf (e.g., rose)
- Cotton swab, tweezers, timer, pH paper
- Gloves, safety goggles

## Procedure
1. Label the three cups as 1, 2, and 3.
2. Place a piece of marble in each cup.
3. Add liquids:
   - Cup 1: 10 ml water
   - Cup 2: 10 ml vinegar
   - Cup 3: 10 ml HCl
4. Wait 30 minutes and observe changes:
   - Bubbling, color, mass, texture
5. Using a cotton swab, apply HCl on a plant leaf. Wait 30 minutes and observe changes.

## Expected Observations
- Cup 1: No visible reaction
- Cup 2: Minor bubbling (CO₂ released)
- Cup 3: Strong bubbling, mass decrease
- Leaf: Tissue damage, color change
