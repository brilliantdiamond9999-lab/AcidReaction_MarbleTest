# Multidisciplinary Analysis

## Chemistry
- Reaction: CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂↑
- Acid strength determines reaction speed.

## Classical Physics
- Gas release creates pressure and bubble formation.
- Mass conservation applies.

## Quantum Physics
- Breaking of ionic bonds Ca–CO₃ involves electron exchange.
- Molecular-level interactions determine reaction energy.

## Mathematics
- Measure bubble count, rate of reaction, mass change.
- Ratios and percentages quantify differences.

## Biology
- Acid damages cell walls and chlorophyll in plant tissue.

## Materials Science
- Marble's crystalline structure influences resistance to acid.
- Surface erosion and dissolution depend on molecular bonds.
